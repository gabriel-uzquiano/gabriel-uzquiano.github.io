## problems

### sets and relations

1. Find a relation $$R$$ on the set of English words $$W$$ with each of the profiles given below:&nbsp;

   1. irreflexive, asymmetric, and transitive on $$W$$.

   2. reflexive and euclidean on $$W$$.

   3. irreflexive, symmetric, and intransitive on $$W$$.&nbsp;

      

   Please justify your answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

2. Justify each of the claims given below:&nbsp;

   1. A relation $$R$$ is symmetric and transitive on a set $$A$$ if, and only if, $$R$$ is euclidean on $$A$$.

      

   2. If a relation $$R$$ is both reflexive and euclidean on a set $$A$$, then $$R$$ is symmetric on $$A$$.

      

   3. $$R$$ is an equivalence relation on a set $$A$$ if, and only if, $$R$$ is reflexive and euclidean on $$A$$.&nbsp;

### propositional logic

1. Call a formula $$\varphi$$ of propositional logic *positive* if, and only if, there are no occurrences of negation $$\neg$$ in $$\varphi$$. Justify each of the following claims:&nbsp;

   1. Every positive formula has an odd number of symbols.

   2. Every positive formula is satisfiable.&nbsp;

      

2. True or false? If true, please provide an argument. If false, provide a counterexample.&nbsp;

   1. Given a set of formulas $$\Gamma$$ and two formulas $$\varphi$$ and $$\psi$$, 

      if $$\Gamma \not \models \varphi$$ or $$\Gamma \models \psi$$, then $$\Gamma \models \varphi \to \psi$$.

   2. Given a set of formulas $$\Gamma$$ and two formulas $$\varphi$$ and $$\psi$$, 

      if $$\Gamma \models \varphi \to \psi$$, then $$\Gamma \not \models \varphi$$ or $$\Gamma \models \psi$$.&nbsp;

Consider the formula:
$$
\Box (\Box P \to P) \to \Box P
$$
Prove that it is valid in a frame $$\langle W, R\rangle$$ if, and only if, $$R$$ is converse well-founded on $$W$$.
