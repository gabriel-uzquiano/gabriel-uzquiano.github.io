course description

These modalities play a crucial role in philosophy and appear to be governed by a common logic.We will cover basic elements of propositional and quantified modal logic with an eye to philosophical applications.

course requirements

:	participation<br/>The course will be based on active participation and discussion. You will be expected to be present and prepared to ask questions, contribute to discussion, and to be helpful to others. Your collective participation in discussion will help set the pace for the course.

:	problems<br/>One important aspect of the course is the opportunity to apply the material and develop some of the skills you will acquire in the course through biweekly problem sets. We will discuss some, if not most of the exercises as a group, but you will be responsible for a write-up in which you explain each question and walk through your solution to the problem by means of a careful step-by-step justification.

:	presentations<br/>We will have a problem session every other Tuesday before the written submissions are due. We will use those sessions to discuss some, if not all of the problems as a group. To facilitate discussion, you will be expected to present your answers to a problem of your choice. Your presentation may or may not include a solution to the problem. What is more important for purposes of discussion is to explain what the question is and briefly explain how the problem fits with the material of the course. You may then explain your own attempt to solve the problem through a careful description of the steps you plan to take to answer the question.
